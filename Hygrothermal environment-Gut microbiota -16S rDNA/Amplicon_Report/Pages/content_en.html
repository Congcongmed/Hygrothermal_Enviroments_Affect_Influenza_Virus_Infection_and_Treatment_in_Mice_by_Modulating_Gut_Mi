<br/>
Once the DNA sample(s) was(were) received, a qulity test has been done first, then all the qualified DNA is used to construct a library(libraries). For PCR product, the jagged ends of DNA fragment would be converted into blunt ends by using T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow Fragment and T4 Polynucleotide Kinase. Then add an 'A' base to each 3' end to make it easier to add adapters. After all that, fragments too short would be removed by Ampure beads. For genomics DNA, we use fusion primer with dual index and adapters for PCR,  fragments too short would be removed by Ampure beads too. In both cases, only the qualified library can be used for sequencing. The bioinformatics analysis will be carried on with sequencing data.

The raw data were filtered to eliminate the adapter pollution and low quality to obtain clean reads, then paired-end reads with overlap were merged to tags. And tags were clustered to OTU at 97% sequence similarity. Taxonomic ranks were assigned to OTU representative sequence using Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Nave Bayesian Classifier v.2.2. At last, alpha diversity, beta diversity and the different species screening were analyzed based on OTU and taxonomic ranks.

<br/>
In order to obtain more accurate and reliable results in subsequent bioinformatics analysis[1], the raw data will be pre-processed to get clean data by in-house procedure as following:
<br/>1)	Truncation of sequence reads not having an average quality of 20 over a 30 bp sliding window based on the phred algorithm, and trimmed reads having less than 75% of their original length, as well as its paired read, will be removed; 
<br/>2)	Removal of reads contaminated by adapter(default parameter: 15 bases overlapped by reads and adapter with maximal 3 bases mismatch allowed);
<br/>3)	Removal of reads with ambiguous basa(N base), and its paired reads;
<br/>4)	Removal of reads with low complexity(default: reads with 10 consecutive same base).
<br/>For pooling library with barcode samples mixed, the clean reads were assigned to corresponding samples by allowing 0 base mismatch to barcode sequences with in-house scripts.<br/><br/>Paired-end reads were generated with Illumina HiSeq/MiSeq platform, then the reads with sequencing adapters, N base, poly base, low quality etc were filtered out with default parameters(detailed in Method 1), and the data processing results was listed in Table 1-1.

If the two paired-end reads overlapped, the consensus sequence was generated by <b>FLASH</b>[2](Fast Length Adjustment of Short reads, v1.2.11), and the detailed method is as follows:
<br/>1) Minimal overlapping length: 15 bp;
<br/>2) Mismatching ratio of overlapped region: <= 0.1.
<br/> Removal of paired end reads without overlaps.<br/>
<br/>
The high quality paired-end reads were combined to tags based on overlaps, 1013418 tags were obtained in total with 63338 tags per sample on average, and the average length is 252 bp.<br/>

<h2><a name="result.geneExp"></a>3 Analysis of community patterns</h2>	
<br/>
The tags were clustered to OTU(Operational Taxonomic Unit) by scripts of software USEARCH(v7.0.1090)[3], detailed as follows:
<br/>1) The tags were clustered into OTU with a 97% threshold by using UPARSE, and the OTU unique representative sequences were obtained;
<br/>2)	Chimeras were filtered out by using UCHIME(v4.2.40);
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 16S rDNA and ITS sequences were screened for chimeras by mapping to gold database(v20110519）, UNITE(v20140703) separately, de novo chimera detection was done for 18S rDNA sequences;
<br/>3)	All tags were mapped to each OTU representative sequences using USEARCH GLOBAL, then the tags number of each OTU in each sample will be summarized to OTU abundance table.
<br/>
<br/>
OTU representative sequences were taxonomically classified using Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier v.2.2 trained on the database Greengene_2013_5_99, using 0.6 confidence values as cutoff.<br/>
<br/>Databases used for species annotation:
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16S rDNA is used for bacterial and archaea community: Greengene(default): V201305[8] ; RDP: Release11_5,20160930
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18S rDNA is used for fungal community: Silva(default): Version_132,20180410
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITS is also used for fungal community: UNITE(default): Version_7_2,20171201
<br/>
<br/>
OTUs were Filtered as follow:
<br/>1) Unassigned OTUs were removed;
<br/>2) OTUs not assigned to the target specices were removed. For example, the OTUs assigned to archeae would be removed if the project is about 16S rDNA for bacterial community study.
<br/>The filtered OTUs were used to downstream processing。

Venn diagram could visually display the number of common/unique OTUs in multi-samples/groups. The core microbiomes of different environments could be obtained if combined with the OTU represent species.
<br/>
<br/>
Based on the OTU abundance, OTU of each group was listed, Venn diagram was drawn by VennDiagram of software R(v3.1.1), then the common and specific OTU ID were summarized.
<br/>
<br/>
Different color represents different samples or groups, The interior of each
circle symbolically represents the number of observed OTUs in the certain sample/group. The overlapping area or intersection would represent the set of OTU commonly present in the counterpart samples/groups. Likewise, the single-layer zone represents the number of OTUs uniquely found in the certain sample/group. Venn diagram is suited to 2-5 samples or groups.

In order to display the differences of OTU composition in different samples, Principal component analysis(PCA) was used to construct 2-D graph to summarize factors mainly responsible for this difference, similarity is high if two samples are closely located.
<br/>
<br/>
Based on the OTU abundance information, the relative abundance of each OTU in each sample will be calculated, and the PCA of OTU was done with the relative abundance value. The software used in this step was package 'ade4' of software R(v3.1.1).

PLS-DA is performed in order to sharpen the separation between groups of observations, by hopefully rotating PCA components such that a maximum separation among classes is obtained, and to understand which variables carry the class separating information. Figure 3   is the graph of partial least squares discrimination analysis.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/><b>3.1.7 OTU rank curve</b><br/>
<br/>
OTU rank abundance curve provides a means for visually representing species richness and species evenness. Species richness can be viewed as the number of different species on the chart (X-axis)i.e., how many species were ranked. Species evenness is derived from the slope of the line that fits the graph. A steep gradient indicates low evenness as the high ranking species have much higher abundances than the low ranking species. A shallow gradient indicates high evenness as the abundances of different species are similar.
<br/>
<br/>
OTU were ranked by the relative abundance value as x-axis, and the OTU relative abundance was as y-axis, then the rank curve were drawn by software R(v3.1.1).

<br/>
The tags number of each taxonomic rank(Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species) or OTU in different samples were summarized in a profiling table or histogram, and the histogram was drawn with the software R(v3.1.1).
<br/>
<br/><b>Figure 3-4-* </b> are the taxonomics composition distribution histograms of each sample were shown at Phylum, Order, Class, Family, Genus, Species level separately.

<br/>A heat map is a graphical representation of data where the individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors. Here species clustering based on the abundance of each species was shown by heat map, longitudinal clustering indicates the similarity of all species among different samples, and the horizontal clustering indicates the similarity of certain species among different samples, the closer the distance is and the shorter the branch length is, the more similar the species composition is between the samples. At Phylum, all species were used to draw the heat map. The species of which abundance is less than 0.5% in all samples were classified into 'others' in other ranks. <b>Figure 3-5-*</b> shows the species clustering heat map at different taxonomic ranks.
<br/>
<br/>
Species heat map analysis was done based on the relative abundance of each species in each sample. To minimize the differences degree of the relative abundance value, the values were all log transformed. If the relative abundance of certain species is 0, the half of the minimum abundance value will substituted for it. Heatmaps were generated using the package 'gplots' of software R(v3.1.1) and the distance algorithm is 'euclidean', the clustering method is 'complete'.

<br/><b>3.2.3 Species phylogenetic analysis </b><br/>
<br/>A phylogenetic tree is a branching diagram showing the inferred evolutionary relationships among various biological species or other entities(their phylogeny) based upon similarities and differences in their physical or genetic characteristics. The evolution distance between species is closer if the branch length is shorter. Besides the species composition and abundance analysis above, phylogenetic tree could clarify the species evolution relationship further.
<br/>
<br/>
The representative sequences were aligned against the Silva core set(Silva_108_core_aligned_seqs) using PyNAST by 'align_seqs.py'. A representative OTU phylogenetic tree was constructed using the QIIME(v1.80) built-in scripts including the fasttree method for tree construction. The tags with highest abundance of each Genus was chosen as the corresponding Genus representative sequences, and Genus level phylogenetic tree was obtained by the same way of OTU phylogenetic tree. The phylogeny tree was imaged by software R(v3.1.1) at last.

<h2><a name="result.deepAnalysisOfGeneExp"></a>4 Diversity analysis</h2>
<br/>
<h3><a name="result.corStat"></a>4.1 Diversity analysis with single sample</h3>
<br/>
Alpha diversity is applied for analyzing complexity of species[11] diversity for a sample through several indices, including observed species, chao1, ace, shannon and simpson. The complexity of sample is proportional with the first four values, while with a negative correlation with simpson value.
<br/>
<br/>
Observed species value, chao1 value and ACE value can reflect the species richness of community, and the rarefaction curve based on the three values could also be used to evaluate if produced data is enough to cover all species in the community. When the curve tends to be smooth, it suggests the produced data is enough. Otherwise, when the curve continues to climb with increasing  sequencing effort, it shows a high complexity in samples, and there still be species uncovered by the sequencing data. 
<br/>
<br/>
Shannon value and simpson value can reflect the species diversity of the community, affected by both species richness and species evenness, that is the two values also consider the abundance of each species. With the same species richness, the greater the species evenness, the greater the community diversity. 
<br/>
<br/>
 The indices are calculated by Mothur(v1.31.2), and the corresponding rarefaction curve are drawn by software R(v3.1.1). The calculation formula of each indice can refer to <a href="http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Calculators"> http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Calculators </a> and the method of drawing rarefaction curve is as  follows,
<br/>1) Calculating OTU numbers based on extracted tags (in multiples of 500);
<br/>2) Rarefraction curve was drawn using the indices calculated with extracted tags.
<br/>
<br/>
If the samples belong to different groups, and the sample number in per group is more than 3, differential analysis among groups could be done using the alpha diversity indices. And Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test is used for two groups comparation, while Kruskal-Wallis Test is used for multi-groups comparation. And then plotbox of alpha diversity is drawn, the analysis above is done by software R(v3.1.1).

<br/>Beta diversity analysis was used to evaluate differences of samples in species complexity. Beta diversity analysis was done by software QIIME(v1.80). There is differences in sequencing depth in different samples, normalization is introduced: Sequences is extracted randomly according to the minimum sequence number for all samples, the extracted sequences formed a new ‘OTU table biom’ file, then the beta diversity distance will be calculated base on the ‘OTU table biom’ file.<br/>
<br/>
Various values, such as Bray-Curtis, weighted UniFrac, unweighted UniFrac, pearson, could be used to measure beta diversity, especially the first three values.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bray-Curtis distance is a commonly used index to reflect the differences between two communities, and its value is between zero and one, zero Bray-Curtis represents exact similar community structure.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UniFrac uses the system evolution information to compare the composition of community species between samples. The results can be used as a measure of beta diversity. It takes into account the distance of evolution between the species, and the bigger index is the greater differences between samples. The UniFrac is divided into weighted UniFrac and unweighted UniFrac, and the weighted UniFrac considering the abundance of sequences while unweighted UniFrac do not.

<br/>
Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) is a type of hierarchical clustering method using average linkage and was used to interpreting the distance matrix produced by beta diversity. To measure the robustness of this result to sequencing effort, we perform a jackknifing analysis, wherein 75% of the smallest sample sequences from each sample are chosen at random, and the resulting UPGMA tree from this subset of data is compared with the tree representing the entire available data set by QIIME(v1.80). This process is repeated with 100 random subsets of data, and the tree nodes which prove more consistent across jackknifed datasets are deemed more robust. And the figure is drawn by software R(v3.1.1).

We use the method of statistical to get the abundance differences of microbial communities between samples, and FDR (false discovery rate) is adopted to assess the significance of differences. From the results, we can identify the samples that cause the species composition differences between two groups. The significant difference between the groups are analyzed at the level of Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species.

16S/18S/ITS/Functional gene(FunGene, such as amoA, mcrA) analysis was mainly applied for host intestine, soil, water and so on. Analysis hotspots for this kind of research are mainly focused on differences among samples in species composition and corresponding abundance[13-17].
<br/>
<br/>
In analysis results, there are three important files in the directory <b>OTU_Cluster_Taxonomy</b>: <b>OTU_table_for_biom.txt </b>(containing species composition for each sample), <b>Species_heatmap/</b> (visualized result of OTU taxonmy and abundance in each sample), <b>Taxa_summary</b> (including comparison among samples in different taxonomic levels. Please focus on the table in which different samples could be separated significantly, and then understand backgrounds of these species to correlate with environmental adaption). Results about sample diversity are mainly included in directory <b>Alpha_diversity/</b> and <b>Beta_diversity/</b> with files representing complexity in samples (Alpha diversity and rarefaction), complexity differences between samples(Beta diversity) etc. 
<br/>
<br/>
For different groups, PCA on OTU abundance, heat map on species abundance and heat map on beta diversity all visually reflect the differences among groups. If the samples belonging to the same group were clustered together, the samples of the same group has the similar species composition. And <b>Diff_Analysis/</b> could give the significant species responsible for the differences using statistics method.

<br/><h2><a name="format.fasta"></a>2 FASTA format</h2>	
<br/>Fasta format (also called Pearson format) which based on the format of text is used to record the sequences of DNA and protein. In the format, the sequence of DNA and protein are coded by single characters, and the name is allowed to be added as annotation at the beginning of each sequence. The first line of the sequence file is start by the symbol of '>' or ';' which is followed by annotation. The sequence is started from the second line, and only allowed characters can be used for coding. For DNA sequences, capitals or lowercases can be used for coding; for protein sequence, only capitals can be used. For example:
<br/>&gt;Sample1_Tag1
<br/>TGAGGAATATTGGTCAATGGACGCAAGTCTGAACCAGCCATGCCGCGTGCAGGATGACGGTCCTATGGATTGTAAACTGCTTTTGTACGAGAAGAAAC
<br/>ACTCCTACGTGTAGGAGCTTGACGGTATCGTAAGAATAAGGATCGGCTAACTCC
